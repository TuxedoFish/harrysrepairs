    review: 'Very knowledgeable repairer who knows his stuff very well. Had to get my IPhone 7 home button replaced, and was very put at ease with Harry’s knowledge of the internal routings of the phone and how to take apart and replace every component. Very reasonably priced (far better than any companies offering similar services), which coupled with the peace of mind of Harry working on the phone, means that I cannot recommend Harry’s Repairs service enough 10/10',

  {
    name: 'Rob',
    review: 'I’m impressed with the level of service provided as my phone was repaired on the day it was received and then it was sent back to me on the same day in a very well packaged box to protect the phone. Harry offers a very good deal which is cheaper than most repair shops. If I ever have any problems in the future with my phone then I’m definitely using Harry’s repairs. 10/10 and a great bloke.',
