      `
      Pendulum Drop is a casual mobile game for Android devices. 
      You swing between branches and collect coins to spend in the store. 
      There are 9 skins to collect in total. If you can get a highscore of 
      over 30 tag me in a photo of you on social media or email me a photo 
      and I can add you to the special mentions in the game! 
      `,
      ` 
      The game was developed in Android Studio using the libgdx library. 
      I handled the box2D physics manually and created the majority of the graphics 
      for the game! The entire code base is Java, and whilst it was originally ported
      to iOS, in the 2020 reboot I opted not to release it on the app store.
      `,
      `
      The game is available now on the play store:

      `  
      RefMe makes the process of searching for reputable sources
      much easier. Using the app you can search for a specific topic and instantly find
      multiple resources chosen for their reputation by the team at X5gon.
      `,
      `
      RefMe was created over the period of 48 hours for a hackathon at UCL. 
      RefMe was coded in React Native however in order to get the pdf functionality 
      working the app did need to use some native Android features. To port it over
      to iOS would not be too difficult however I do not have an Apple developer account!
      I developed the app with Nogg Harris and the codebase is available 
      on my github.
      `,
      `
      The app is available now on the play store:

      `
        I know so many people at University who have great ideas for apps. They have 
        the ideas but they seem afraid to get down to creating. Therefore I wanted 
        to create a series of tutorials which gave the reader the basic skills necessary 
        to prototype app ideas. The skills I aimed to teach in this series were: creating
        layouts, connecting views and good coding practice.
      `,
      `
      Sound interested? Check the series out here:

    title: "UCL API (Website)",
    description: [
      `
      During my time at UCL, I worked as a student developer for the UCL API. The project was started
      a few years before I joined with the aim of making it possible for all the data that UCL collects
      to be accessible in a format any developer could access. 
      `,
      `
      I worked primarily on web development and helped to change the website to how it looks currently. 
      I also helped to a small degree on the application UCL Assistant which used the API in an app form
      as a more reliable source of information for students then the out sourced application.
      `,
      `
      Check out the API here:

      W8S analyses your weightlifting form to calculate how much power you put into your lifts.
      It also tracks other variables such as your form. 
      `,
      `
      As part of designing this project I created an informational website where people can sign up
      to a newsletter as well as a promotional video for the app. The web design work was inspired
      from my work on uclapi. I try to keep my websites simple and to the point:

    description: [`
    During the global coronavirus pandemic I worked alongside
    other students at Imperial College London and University
    College London to prototype a contact tracing app which
    used a decentralised system.
    `,
    `
    The app was coded natively in Android however due to the sensitivity of
    the crisis we are unable to release the demo to the wider public. I have 
    however linked to the website for the project:
